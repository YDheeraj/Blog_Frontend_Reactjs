# React Blogging Website

This project is a React-based blogging website that utilizes the JSON Placeholder API for fetching blog posts, comments, and author information. It allows users to browse, read, and interact with blog posts, add posts to their favorites, and manage their favorite blog posts. The website features a responsive design, error handling, and various optional features like commenting and search functionality.

## Features

- **Main Page**: The main page displays a list of blog post titles along with a preview of each post's body content. Users can scroll through the posts and click on a title to view the full content of a blog post.

- **Individual Blog Post Pages**: Clicking on a blog post title redirects users to a dedicated page that displays the full content of the blog post. The page also includes author information and a heart or favorite icon/button to add the post to the user's favorites list.

- **Favorites List**: The website includes a separate page that shows the list of favorite blog posts. Users can access this page to view the titles and authors of their saved posts. They also have the option to remove posts from their favorites list.

- **Error Handling**: The project implements error handling to display appropriate error messages if any issues occur while fetching data or managing favorites.

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive and adapt to different devices and screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience.

### Optional Features

- **Commenting Functionality**: Users can leave comments on blog posts, allowing for engagement and discussion.

- **Search Feature**: The website includes a search feature that enables users to search for specific blog posts based on titles or authors, facilitating easy content discovery.

- **Local Storage Persistence**: User favorites and comments are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring that their preferences are persisted across page reloads.
